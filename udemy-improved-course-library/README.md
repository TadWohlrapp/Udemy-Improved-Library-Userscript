### This UserScript adds additional course stats to your courses in your Udemy course library.

It employs the Udemy API to grab a link to the course overview page, the rating including stars, the number of ratings, and the number of students enrolled in the course. Additionally it displays a thin colored strip at the bottom of the course card, from red (3.5 stars and below) to green (5 stars).

This should provide you with a good overview which course is worth its salt, and which course you might want to archive instead.

Note: If a course has stopped enrollment and isn't visible publicly anymore, no stats are available for that course.
