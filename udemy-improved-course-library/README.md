This UserScript improves your Udemy Course Library by adding details to the Course Cards, so you know instantly, which courses are highly rated and popular, and which course you might want to archive instead.

## Udemy API Access required
You will need Udemy API credentials for the script to work. To request them, simply visit https://www.udemy.com/user/edit-api-clients/ and follow the steps there. Be creative.

When running the script for the first time, you will be asked to enter those API credentials. In Tampermonkey and Violent Monkey those credentials can be changed later on. Greasemonkey 4+ decided against supporting options for UserScripts, so once set, you cannot change them anymore.
